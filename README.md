## Overview

In collaboration with Volvo, this innovative project is designed to revolutionize how administrative tasks, such as scheduling meetings and retrieving company-specific information, are managed. By harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including state-of-the-art techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and other advanced AI methodologies, we aim to create an AI Virtual Receptionist that exemplifies the next step in digital assistance.

## Objective

Our primary goal is to develop a proof-of-concept solution that demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating and enhancing administrative functions within a corporate environment. This virtual receptionist will not only facilitate more efficient scheduling and information retrieval processes but also serve as a model for how AI can be integrated into corporate ecosystems to streamline operations and support staff.

## Architecture

**Frontend Interface:** Utilizing the OpenAI platform, our AI Virtual Receptionist, named Receptionata, will interact with users through a GPT-based conversational agent. This interface will be designed for ease of use, ensuring users can effortlessly communicate their needs.

**Backend Infrastructure:** To support the model with additional, domain-specific knowledge, we will deploy a backend server hosted on Azure Container Registry and managed through Azure App Service. This setup will allow for seamless updates and integration of new data, ensuring the AI remains knowledgeable and efficient.

## Features

**Meeting Scheduling:** Automate the coordination of meetings, taking into account participant availability, preferred times, and other logistical considerations.

**Information Retrieval:** Provide quick and accurate access to Volvo-specific knowledge, from policy details to technical documentation.

**Administrative Support:** Assist with a range of administrative tasks, from managing email correspondences to handling routine inquiries, all through natural language commands.

## Project Status
Currently, in its initial stages, this project represents a collaboration between talented students from University of Wrocław and Volvo's commitment to innovation. As we progress, we aim to refine our approach, incorporating feedback and exploring the integration of additional AI techniques to enhance the capabilities of our AI Virtual Receptionist.
