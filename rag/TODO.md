## TODO
- how to load PDF from the web?
- how to load only the relevant part of the HTML?
- how to split the text?
    - is generic splitting enough?
    - use LLM to determine chunks of coherent content?
- how to test the generated outputs?
- create query template
    - perhaps use XML-like structure
- how to use OpenAI API?
- env vars
    - DB URL
- dockerize
    - env vars
    - only ChromaDB for now
    - then API as well
- [later on, maybe] create an API in Python
- LLM interface to be able to run local LLM as well as use external API
- switch to open-source wherever possible
